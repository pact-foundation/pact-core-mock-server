//! The `pact_matching` crate provides the core logic to performing matching on HTTP requests
//! and responses. It implements the V3 Pact specification (https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-3).
//!
//! ## To use it
//!
//! To use it, add it to your dependencies in your cargo manifest.
//!
//! This crate provides two functions: [`match_request`](fn.match_request.html) and [`match_response`](fn.match_response.html).
//! These functions take an expected and actual request or response
//! model from the [`models`)(models/index.html) module, and return a vector of mismatches.
//!
//! To compare any incoming request, it first needs to be converted to a [`models::Request`](models/struct.Request.html) and then can be compared. Same for
//! any response.
//!
//! ## Reading and writing Pact files
//!
//! The [`Pact`](models/struct.Pact.html) struct in the [`models`)(models/index.html) module has methods to read and write pact JSON files. It supports all the specification
//! versions up to V3, but will converted a V1 and V1.1 spec file to a V2 format.
//!
//! ## Matching request and response parts
//!
//! V3 specification matching is supported for both JSON and XML bodies, headers, query strings and request paths.
//!
//! To understand the basic rules of matching, see [Matching Gotchas](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact/wiki/Matching-gotchas).
//! For example test cases for matching, see the [Pact Specification Project, version 3](https://github.com/bethesque/pact-specification/tree/version-3).
//!
//! By default, Pact will use string equality matching following Postel's Law. This means
//! that for an actual value to match an expected one, they both must consist of the same
//! sequence of characters. For collections (basically Maps and Lists), they must have the
//! same elements that match in the same sequence, with cases where the additional elements
//! in an actual Map are ignored.
//!
//! Matching rules can be defined for both request and response elements based on a pseudo JSON-Path
//! syntax.
//!
//! ### Matching Bodies
//!
//! For the most part, matching involves matching request and response bodies in JSON or XML format.
//! Other formats will either have their own matching rules, or will follow the JSON one.
//!
//! #### JSON body matching rules
//!
//! Bodies consist of Objects (Maps of Key-Value pairs), Arrays (Lists) and values (Strings, Numbers, true, false, null).
//! Body matching rules are prefixed with `$`.
//!
//! The following method is used to determine if two bodies match:
//!
//! 1. If both the actual body and expected body are empty, the bodies match.
//! 2. If the actual body is non-empty, and the expected body empty, the bodies match.
//! 3. If the actual body is empty, and the expected body non-empty, the bodies don't match.
//! 4. Otherwise do a comparison on the contents of the bodies.
//!
//! ##### For the body contents comparison:
//!
//! 1. If the actual and expected values are both Objects, compare as Maps.
//! 2. If the actual and expected values are both Arrays, compare as Lists.
//! 3. If the expected value is an Object, and the actual is not, they don't match.
//! 4. If the expected value is an Array, and the actual is not, they don't match.
//! 5. Otherwise, compare the values
//!
//! ##### For comparing Maps
//!
//! 1. If the actual map is non-empty while the expected is empty, they don't match.
//! 2. If we allow unexpected keys, and the number of expected keys is greater than the actual keys,
//! they don't match.
//! 3. If we don't allow unexpected keys, and the expected and actual maps don't have the
//! same number of keys, they don't match.
//! 4. Otherwise, for each expected key and value pair:
//!     1. if the actual map contains the key, compare the values
//!     2. otherwise they don't match
//!
//! Postel's law governs if we allow unexpected keys or not.
//!
//! ##### For comparing lists
//!
//! 1. If there is a body matcher defined that matches the path to the list, default
//! to that matcher and then compare the list contents.
//! 2. If the expected list is empty and the actual one is not, the lists don't match.
//! 3. Otherwise
//!     1. compare the list sizes
//!     2. compare the list contents
//!
//! ###### For comparing list contents
//!
//! 1. For each value in the expected list:
//!     1. If the index of the value is less than the actual list's size, compare the value
//!        with the actual value at the same index using the method for comparing values.
//!     2. Otherwise the value doesn't match
//!
//! ##### For comparing values
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined that matches the path to the value, default to that
//! matcher
//! 2. Otherwise compare the values using equality.
//!
//! #### XML body matching rules
//!
//! Bodies consist of a root element, Elements (Lists with children), Attributes (Maps) and values (Strings).
//! Body matching rules are prefixed with `$`.
//!
//! The following method is used to determine if two bodies match:
//!
//! 1. If both the actual body and expected body are empty, the bodies match.
//! 2. If the actual body is non-empty, and the expected body empty, the bodies match.
//! 3. If the actual body is empty, and the expected body non-empty, the bodies don't match.
//! 4. Otherwise do a comparison on the contents of the bodies.
//!
//! ##### For the body contents comparison:
//!
//! Start by comparing the root element.
//!
//! ##### For comparing elements
//!
//! 1. If there is a body matcher defined that matches the path to the element, default
//! to that matcher on the elements name or children.
//! 2. Otherwise the elements match if they have the same name.
//!
//! Then, if there are no mismatches:
//!
//! 1. compare the attributes of the element
//! 2. compare the child elements
//! 3. compare the text nodes
//!
//! ##### For comparing attributes
//!
//! Attributes are treated as a map of key-value pairs.
//!
//! 1. If the actual map is non-empty while the expected is empty, they don't match.
//! 2. If we allow unexpected keys, and the number of expected keys is greater than the actual keys,
//! they don't match.
//! 3. If we don't allow unexpected keys, and the expected and actual maps don't have the
//! same number of keys, they don't match.
//!
//! Then, for each expected key and value pair:
//!
//! 1. if the actual map contains the key, compare the values
//! 2. otherwise they don't match
//!
//! Postel's law governs if we allow unexpected keys or not. Note for matching paths, attribute names are prefixed with an `@`.
//!
//! ###### For comparing child elements
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined for the path to the child elements, then pad out the expected child elements to have the
//! same size as the actual child elements.
//! 2. Otherwise
//!     1. If the actual children is non-empty while the expected is empty, they don't match.
//!     2. If we allow unexpected keys, and the number of expected children is greater than the actual children,
//!     they don't match.
//!     3. If we don't allow unexpected keys, and the expected and actual children don't have the
//!     same number of elements, they don't match.
//!
//! Then, for each expected and actual element pair, compare them using the rules for comparing elements.
//!
//! ##### For comparing text nodes
//!
//! Text nodes are combined into a single string and then compared as values.
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined that matches the path to the text node (text node paths end with `#text`), default to that
//! matcher
//! 2. Otherwise compare the text using equality.
//!
//!
//! ##### For comparing values
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined that matches the path to the value, default to that
//! matcher
//! 2. Otherwise compare the values using equality.
//!
//! ### Matching Paths
//!
//! Paths are matched by the following:
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined for `path`, default to that matcher.
//! 2. Otherwise paths are compared as Strings
//!
//! ### Matching Queries
//!
//! 1. If the actual and expected query strings are empty, they match.
//! 2. If the actual is not empty while the expected is, they don't match.
//! 3. If the actual is empty while the expected is not, they don't match.
//! 4. Otherwise convert both into a Map of keys mapped to a list values, and compare those.
//!
//! #### Matching Query Maps
//!
//! Query strings are parsed into a Map of keys mapped to lists of values. Key value
//! pairs can be in any order, but when the same key appears more than once the values
//! are compared in the order they appear in the query string.
//!
//! ### Matching Headers
//!
//! 1. Do a case-insensitive sort of the headers by keys
//! 2. For each expected header in the sorted list:
//!     1. If the actual headers contain that key, compare the header values
//!     2. Otherwise the header does not match
//!
//! For matching header values:
//!
//! 1. If there is a matcher defined for `header.<HEADER_KEY>`, default to that matcher
//! 2. Otherwise strip all whitespace after commas and compare the resulting strings.
//!
//! #### Matching Request Headers
//!
//! Request headers are matched by excluding the cookie header.
//!
//! #### Matching Request cookies
//!
//! If the list of expected cookies contains all the actual cookies, the cookies match.
//!
//! ### Matching Status Codes
//!
//! Status codes are compared as integer values.
//!
//! ### Matching HTTP Methods
//!
//! The actual and expected methods are compared as case-insensitive strings.
//!
//! ## Matching Rules
//!
//! Pact supports extending the matching rules on each type of object (Request or Response) with a `matchingRules` element in the pact file.
//! This is a map of JSON path strings to a matcher. When an item is being compared, if there is an entry in the matching
//! rules that corresponds to the path to the item, the comparison will be delegated to the defined matcher. Note that the
//! matching rules cascade, so a rule can be specified on a value and will apply to all children of that value.
//!
//! ## Matcher Path expressions
//!
//! Pact does not support the full JSON path expressions, only ones that match the following rules:
//!
//! 1. All paths start with a dollar (`$`), representing the root.
//! 2. All path elements are separated by periods (`.`), except array indices which use square brackets (`[]`).
//! 3. Path elements represent keys.
//! 4. A star (`*`) can be used to match all keys of a map or all items of an array (one level only).
//!
//! So the expression `$.item1.level[2].id` will match the highlighted item in the following body:
//!
//! ```js,ignore
//! {
//!   "item1": {
//!     "level": [
//!       {
//!         "id": 100
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 101
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 102 // <---- $.item1.level[2].id
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 103
//!       }
//!     ]
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! while `$.*.level[*].id` will match all the ids of all the levels for all items.
//!
//! ### Matcher selection algorithm
//!
//! Due to the star notation, there can be multiple matcher paths defined that correspond to an item. The first, most
//! specific expression is selected by assigning weightings to each path element and taking the product of the weightings.
//! The matcher with the path with the largest weighting is used.
//!
//! * The root node (`$`) is assigned the value 2.
//! * Any path element that does not match is assigned the value 0.
//! * Any property name that matches a path element is assigned the value 2.
//! * Any array index that matches a path element is assigned the value 2.
//! * Any star (`*`) that matches a property or array index is assigned the value 1.
//! * Everything else is assigned the value 0.
//!
//! So for the body with highlighted item:
//!
//! ```js,ignore
//! {
//!   "item1": {
//!     "level": [
//!       {
//!         "id": 100
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 101
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 102 // <--- Item under consideration
//!       },
//!       {
//!         "id": 103
//!       }
//!     ]
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The expressions will have the following weightings:
//!
//! | expression | weighting calculation | weighting |
//! |------------|-----------------------|-----------|
//! | $ | $(2) | 2 |
//! | $.item1 | $(2).item1(2) | 4 |
//! | $.item2 | $(2).item2(0) | 0 |
//! | $.item1.level | $(2).item1(2).level(2) | 8 |
//! | $.item1.level\[1\] | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[1(2)\] | 16 |
//! | $.item1.level\[1\].id | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[1(2)\].id(2) | 32 |
//! | $.item1.level\[1\].name | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[1(2)\].name(0) | 0 |
//! | $.item1.level\[2\] | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[2(0)\] | 0 |
//! | $.item1.level\[2\].id | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[2(0)\].id(2) | 0 |
//! | $.item1.level\[*\].id | $(2).item1(2).level(2)\[*(1)\].id(2) | 16 |
//! | $.\*.level\[\*\].id | $(2).*(1).level(2)\[*(1)\].id(2) | 8 |
//!
//! So for the item with id 102, the matcher with path `$.item1.level\[1\].id` and weighting 32 will be selected.
//!
//! ## Supported matchers
//!
//! The following matchers are supported:
//!
//! | matcher | example configuration | description |
//! |---------|-----------------------|-------------|
//! | Equality | `{ "match": "equality" }` | This is the default matcher, and relies on the equals operator |
//! | Regex | `{ "match": "regex", "regex": "\\d+" }` | This executes a regular expression match against the string representation of a values. |
//! | Type | `{ "match": "type" }` | This executes a type based match against the values, that is, they are equal if they are the same type. |
//! | MinType | `{ "match": "type", "min": 2 }` | This executes a type based match against the values, that is, they are equal if they are the same type. In addition, if the values represent a collection, the length of the actual value is compared against the minimum. |
//! | MaxType | `{ "match": "type", "max": 10 }` | This executes a type based match against the values, that is, they are equal if they are the same type. In addition, if the values represent a collection, the length of the actual value is compared against the maximum. |
//! | MinMaxType | `{ "match": "type", "min": 1, "max": 10 }` | This executes a type based match against the values, that is, they are equal if they are the same type. In addition, if the values represent a collection, the length of the actual value is compared against the minimum and maximum. |
//! | Timestamp | `{ "match": "timestamp", "timestamp": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssZZZZZ" }` | Matches a string value against a Date/Time pattern. |
//! | Time | `{ "match": "time", "time": "HH:mm:ssZZZZZ" }` | Matches a string value against a Time pattern. |
//! | Date | `{ "match": "date", "date": "yyyy-MM-dd" }` | Matches a string value against a Date pattern. |
//! | Include | `{ "match": "include", "value": "ello" }` | Checks if a string value contains the given sub-string. |
//! | Number | `{ "match": "number" }` | Matches any numeric type. |
//! | Integer | `{ "match": "integer" }` | Matches a number if it has no digits after the decimal point. |
//! | Decimal | `{ "match": "decimal" }` | Matches a number if it has at least one digit after the decimal point. |
//! | Null | `{ "match": "null" }` | Matches a JSON NULL value. This only makes sense to use with JSON. |
//! | ContentType | `{ "match": "contentType", "value": "image/jpeg" }` | Checks if the value has the content type of the privided value. This is done by performing a magic test on the first few bytes of the value. |
//! | ArrayContains | `{ "match": "arrayContains", "variants": [...] }` | Checks if all the variants are present in an array. |
